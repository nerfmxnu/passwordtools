# passwordtools
the mr. robot tool improved for pentesting

this python script generates up to 10,000 possible passwords based on user-provided words. it first creates common password variations by combining words and appending a single special character at the end. then, it applies case variations and leet transformations to expand the possibilities. more complex passwords are generated by inserting special characters randomly within the words. all passwords are written directly to a file named `password_list.txt` to avoid excessive memory usage. the script prioritizes common and realistic passwords before moving to advanced combinations, ensuring an efficient and structured password generation process.
